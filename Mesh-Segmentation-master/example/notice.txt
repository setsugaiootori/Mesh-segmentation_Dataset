we use crestline as defaut feature line, which lies on the ridge and valleys of a shape.
the computation of crestline are quite sensitive to the size of neighborehood.

So, for a shape mainly composing of sharp regions, we suggest a smaller size of neighborehood, such as octaflower,
and for other example, a slightly larger scale would return better feature lines.

Beside crestline, users are allow to use their own computation of feature line by only minor revision of our source code.
Although we don't propose any new method on tracing feature sensitive curves, our algorithm is open for any input of curves, including interactive sketches.

In our tool, user can use key Q/W to switch the different scale of crestline. For some shape, such as octaflower, the difference is significant.
